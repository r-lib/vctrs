\usage{
vec_order(
  x,
  ...,
  direction = "asc",
  na_value = "largest",
  nan_distinct = FALSE,
  chr_transform = NULL

\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{direction}{Direction to sort in.
\itemize{
\item A single \code{"asc"} or \code{"desc"} for ascending or descending order
respectively.
\item For data frames, a length \code{1} or \code{ncol(x)} character vector containing
only \code{"asc"} or \code{"desc"}, specifying the direction for each column.
}}

\item{na_value}{Treatment of missing values.
\itemize{
\item A single \code{"largest"} or \code{"smallest"} for treating missing values as the
largest or smallest values respectively.
\item For data frames, a length \code{1} or \code{ncol(x)} character vector containing
only \code{"largest"} or \code{"smallest"}, specifying how missing values should
be treated in each column.
}}

\item{nan_distinct}{A single logical specifying whether or not \code{NaN} should
be considered distinct from \code{NA} for double and complex vectors. If \code{TRUE},
\code{NaN} will always be ordered between \code{NA} and non-missing numbers.}

\item{chr_transform}{Transformation of character vectors for sorting in
alternate locales.
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL}, no transformation is done.
\item Otherwise, this must be a function of one argument. The function will be
invoked with \code{x}, if it is a character vector, after it has been
translated to UTF-8, and should return a character vector with the same
length as \code{x}, also encoded as UTF-8.
\item For data frames, \code{chr_transform} will be applied to all character
columns.
}

Common transformation functions include: \code{tolower()} for case-insensitive
ordering and \code{stringi::str_sort_key()} for locale-aware ordering.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{vec_order()} an integer vector the same size as \code{x}.
\item \code{vec_sort()} a vector with the same size and type as \code{x}.
}
}
\description{
\code{vec_order()} computes the order of \code{x}. For data frames, the order is
computed along the rows by computing the order of the first column and
using subsequent columns to break ties.

\code{vec_sort()} sorts \code{x}. It is equivalent to \code{vec_slice(x, vec_order(x))}.
}
\section{Differences with \code{order()}}{


Unlike the \code{na.last} argument of \code{order()} which decides the positions of
missing values irrespective of the \code{decreasing} argument, the \code{na_value}
argument of \code{vec_order()} interacts with \code{direction}. If missing values
are considered the largest value, they will appear last in ascending order,
and first in descending order.

Character vectors are ordered in the C-locale. This is different from
\code{base::order()}, which respects \code{base::Sys.setlocale()}. Sorting in a
consistent locale can produce more reproducible results between different
sessions and platforms, however, the results of sorting in the C-locale
can be surprising. For example, capital letters sort before lower case
letters. Sorting \code{c("b", "C", "a")} with \code{vec_sort()} will return
\code{c("C", "a", "b")}, but with \code{base::order()} will return \code{c("a", "b", "C")}
unless \code{base::order(method = "radix")} is explicitly set, which also uses
the C-locale. While sorting with the C-locale can be useful for
algorithmic efficiency, in many real world uses it can be the cause of
data analysis mistakes. To balance these trade-offs, you can supply a
\code{chr_transform} to transform character vectors into an alternative
representation that orders in the C-locale in a less surprising way. For
example, providing \code{\link[base:chartr]{base::tolower()}} as a transform will order the original
vector in a case-insensitive manner. Locale-aware ordering can be achieved
by providing \code{stringi::stri_sort_key()} as a transform, setting the
collation options as appropriate for your locale.

Character vectors are always translated to UTF-8 before ordering, and before
any transform is applied by \code{chr_transform}.

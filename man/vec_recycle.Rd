\usage{
vec_recycle(x, size, ..., x_arg = "", call = caller_env())

vec_recycle_common(..., .size = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to recycle.}

\item{size}{Desired output size.}

\item{...}{\itemize{
\item For \code{vec_recycle_common()}, vectors to recycle.
\itemize{
\item For \code{vec_recycle()}, these dots should be empty.
}
}}

\item{x_arg}{Argument name for \code{x}. These are used in error
messages to inform the user about which argument has an
incompatible size.}

\item{call}{The execution environment of a currently
running function, e.g. \code{caller_env()}. The function will be
mentioned in error messages as the source of the error. See the
\code{call} argument of \code{\link[rlang:abort]{abort()}} for more information.}

\item{.size}{Desired output size. If omitted,
will use the common size from \code{\link[=vec_size_common]{vec_size_common()}}.}
}
\description{
\code{vec_recycle(x, size)} recycles a single vector to given size.
\code{vec_recycle_common(...)} recycles multiple vectors to their common size.
All functions obey the vctrs recycling rules, described below, and will
throw an error if recycling is not possible. See \code{\link[=vec_size]{vec_size()}} for the
precise definition of size.
}
\section{Recycling rules}{

The common size of two vectors defines the recycling rules, and can be
summarise with the following table:

\figure{sizes-recycling.png}

(Note \code{NULL}s are handled specially; they are treated like empty
arguments and hence don't affect the size)

This is a stricter set of rules than base R, which will usually
return output of length \code{max(nx, ny)}, warning if the length of the longer
vector is not an integer multiple of the length of the shorter.

We say that two vectors have \strong{compatible size} if they can be
recycled to be the same length.

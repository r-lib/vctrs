\subsection{Combination mechanism in vctrs}{

The coercion system in vctrs is designed to make combination of multiple
inputs consistent and extensible. Combinations occur in many places,
such as row-binding, joins, subset-assignment, or grouped summary
functions that use the split-apply-combine strategy. For example:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{vec_c(TRUE, 1)
#> [1] 1 1

vec_c("a", 1)
#> Error: Can't combine `..1` <character> and `..2` <double>.

vec_rbind(
  data.frame(x = TRUE),
  data.frame(x = 1, y = 2)
)
#>   x  y
#> 1 1 NA
#> 2 1  2

vec_rbind(
  data.frame(x = "a"),
  data.frame(x = 1, y = 2)
)
#> Error: Can't combine `..1$x` <character> and `..2$x` <double>.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

One major goal of vctrs is to provide a central place for implementing
the coercion methods that make generic combinations possible. The two
relevant generics are \code{vec_ptype2()} and \code{vec_cast()}. They both take
two arguments and perform \strong{double dispatch}, meaning that a method is
selected based on the classes of both inputs.

The general mechanism for combining multiple inputs is:
\enumerate{
\item Find the common type of a set of inputs by reducing (as in
\code{base::Reduce()} or \code{purrr::reduce()}) the \code{vec_ptype2()} binary
function over the set.
\item Convert all inputs to the common type with \code{vec_cast()}.
\item Initialise the output vector as an instance of this common type with
\code{vec_init()}.
\item Fill the output vector with the elements of the inputs using
\code{vec_assign()}.
}

The last two steps may require \code{vec_proxy()} and \code{vec_restore()}
implementations, unless the attributes of your class are constant and do
not depend on the contents of the vector. We focus here on the first two
steps, which require \code{vec_ptype2()} and \code{vec_cast()} implementations.
}

\subsection{\code{vec_ptype2()}}{

Methods for \code{vec_ptype2()} are passed two \emph{prototypes}, i.e. two inputs
emptied of their elements. They implement two behaviours:
\itemize{
\item If the types of their inputs are compatible, indicate which of them
is the richer type by returning it. If the types are of equal
resolution, return any of the two.
\item Throw an error with \code{stop_incompatible_type()} when it can be
determined from the attributes that the types of the inputs are not
compatible.
}
\subsection{Type compatibility}{

A type is \strong{compatible} with another type if the values it represents
are a subset or a superset of the values of the other type. The notion
of “value” is to be interpreted at a high level, in particular it is not
the same as the memory representation. For example, factors are
represented in memory with integers but their values are more related to
character vectors than to round numbers:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{# Two factors are compatible
vec_ptype2(factor("a"), factor("b"))
#> factor(0)
#> Levels: a b

# Factors are compatible with a character
vec_ptype2(factor("a"), "b")
#> character(0)

# But they are incompatible with integers
vec_ptype2(factor("a"), 1L)
#> Error: Can't combine <factor<4d52a>> and <integer>.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\subsection{Richness of type}{

Richness of type is not a very precise notion. It can be about richer
data (for instance a \code{double} vector covers more values than an integer
vector), richer behaviour (a \code{data.table} has richer behaviour than a
\code{data.frame}), or both. If you have trouble determining which one of the
two types is richer, it probably means they shouldn’t be automatically
coercible.

Let’s look again at what happens when we combine a factor and a
character:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{vec_ptype2(factor("a"), "b")
#> character(0)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The ptype2 method for \verb{<character>} and \verb{<factor<"a">>} returns
\verb{<character>} because the former is a richer type. The factor can only
contain \code{"a"} strings, whereas the character can contain any strings. In
this sense, factors are a \emph{subset} of character.

Note that another valid behaviour would be to throw an incompatible type
error. This is what a strict factor implementation would do. We have
decided to be laxer in vctrs because it is easy to inadvertently create
factors instead of character vectors, especially with older versions of
R where \code{stringsAsFactors} is still true by default.
}

\subsection{Consistency and symmetry on permutation}{

Each ptype2 method should strive to have exactly the same behaviour when
the inputs are permuted. This is not always possible, for example factor
levels are aggregated in order:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{vec_ptype2(factor(c("a", "c")), factor("b"))
#> factor(0)
#> Levels: a c b

vec_ptype2(factor("b"), factor(c("a", "c")))
#> factor(0)
#> Levels: b a c
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

In any case, permuting the input should not return a fundamentally
different type or introduce an incompatible type error.
}

\subsection{Coercion hierarchy}{

Coercible classes form a coercion (or subtyping) hierarchy. Here is a
simplified diagram of the hierarchy for base types. In this diagram the
directions of the arrows express which type is richer. They flow from
the bottom (more constrained types) to the top (richer types).

\figure{coerce.png}

As a class implementor, you have two options. The simplest is to create
an entirely separate hierarchy. The date and date-time classes are an
example of an S3-based hierarchy that is completely separate.
Alternatively, you can integrate your class in an existing hierarchy,
typically by adding parent nodes on top of the hierarchy (your class is
richer), by adding children node at the root of the hierarchy (your
class is more constrained), or by inserting a node in the tree.

These coercion hierarchies are \emph{implicit}, in the sense that they are
implied by the \code{vec_ptype2()} implementations. There is no structured
way to create or modify a hierarchy, instead you need to implement the
appropriate coercion methods for all the types in your hierarchy, and
diligently return the richer type in each case. The \code{vec_ptype2()}
implementations are not transitive nor inherited, so all pairwise
methods between classes lying on a given path must be implemented
manually. This is something we might make easier in the future.
}

}

\subsection{\code{vec_cast()}}{

The second generic, \code{vec_cast()}, is the one that looks at the data and
actually performs the conversion. Because it has access to more
information than \code{vec_ptype2()}, it may be stricter and cause an error
in more cases. \code{vec_cast()} has three possible behaviours:
\itemize{
\item Determine that the prototypes of the two inputs are not compatible.
This must be decided in exactly the same way as for \code{vec_ptype2()}.
Call \code{stop_incompatible_cast()} if you can determine from the
attributes that the types are not compatible.
\item Detect incompatible values. Usually this is because the target type
is too restricted for the values supported by the input type. For
example, a fractional number can’t be converted to an integer. The
method should throw an error in that case.
\item Return the input vector converted to the target type if all values
are compatible. Whereas \code{vec_ptype2()} must return the same type
when the inputs are permuted, \code{vec_cast()} is \emph{directional}. It
always returns the type of the right-hand side, or dies trying.
}
}

\subsection{Double dispatch}{

The dispatch mechanism for \code{vec_ptype2()} and \code{vec_cast()} looks like S3
but is actually a custom mechanism. Compared to S3, it has the following
differences:
\itemize{
\item It dispatches on the classes of the first two inputs.
\item There is no inheritance of ptype2 and cast methods. This is because
the S3 class hierarchy is not necessarily the same as the coercion
hierarchy.
\item \code{NextMethod()} does not work. Parent methods must be called
explicitly if necessary.
\item The default method is hard-coded.
}
}

\subsection{Data frames}{

The determination of the common type of data frames with \code{vec_ptype2()}
happens in three steps:
\enumerate{
\item Match the columns of the two input data frames. If some columns
don’t exist, they are created and filled with adequately typed \code{NA}
values.
\item Find the common type for each column by calling \code{vec_ptype2()} on
each pair of matched columns.
\item Find the common data frame type. For example the common type of a
grouped tibble and a tibble is a grouped tibble because the latter
is the richer type. The common type of a data table and a data frame
is a data table.
}

\code{vec_cast()} operates similarly. If a data frame is cast to a target
type that has fewer columns, this is an error.

If you are implementing coercion methods for data frames, you will need
to explicitly call the parent methods that perform the common type
determination or the type conversion described above. These are exported
as \code{\link[=df_ptype2]{df_ptype2()}} and \code{\link[=df_cast]{df_cast()}}.
\subsection{Data frame fallbacks}{

Being too strict with data frame combinations would cause too much pain
because there are many data frame subclasses in the wild that don’t
implement vctrs methods. We have decided to implement a special fallback
behaviour for foreign data frames. Incompatible data frames fall back to
a base data frame:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{df1 <- data.frame(x = 1)
df2 <- structure(df1, class = c("foreign_df", "data.frame"))

vec_rbind(df1, df2)
#>   x
#> 1 1
#> 2 1
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

When a tibble is involved, we fall back to tibble:\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{df3 <- tibble::as_tibble(df1)

vec_rbind(df1, df3)
#> # A tibble: 2 x 1
#>       x
#>   <dbl>
#> 1     1
#> 2     1
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

These fallbacks are not ideal but they make sense because all data
frames share a common data structure. This is not generally the case for
vectors. For example factors and characters have different
representations, and it is not possible to find a fallback time
mechanically.

However this fallback has a big downside: implementing vctrs methods for
your data frame subclass is a breaking behaviour change. The proper
coercion behaviour for your data frame class should be specified as soon
as possible to limit the consequences of changing the behaviour of your
class in R scripts.

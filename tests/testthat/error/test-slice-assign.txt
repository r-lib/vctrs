`vec_assign()` requires recyclable value
========================================

> vec_assign(1:3, 1:3, 1:2)
Error: Can't recycle input of size 2 to size 3.


logical subscripts must match size of indexed vector
====================================================

> vec_assign(1:2, c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 5)
Error: Must assign to elements with a valid subscript vector.
i Logical subscripts must match the size of the indexed input.
x Input has size 2 but subscript has size 3.

> vec_assign(mtcars, c(TRUE, FALSE), mtcars[1, ])
Error: Must assign to elements with a valid subscript vector.
i Logical subscripts must match the size of the indexed input.
x Input has size 32 but subscript has size 2.


must assign existing elements
=============================

> vec_assign(1:3, 5, 10)
Error: Can't assign to elements that don't exist.
x Location 5 doesn't exist.
i There are only 3 elements.

> vec_assign(1:3, "foo", 10)
Error: Can't use character names to index an unnamed vector.

> vec_slice(letters, -100) <- "foo"
Error: Can't negate elements that don't exist.
x Location 100 doesn't exist.
i There are only 26 elements.

> vec_assign(set_names(letters), "foo", "bar")
Error: Can't assign to elements that don't exist.
x Element `foo` doesn't exist.


must assign with proper negative locations
==========================================

> vec_assign(1:3, c(-1, 1), 1:2)
Error: Must assign to elements with a valid subscript vector.
x Negative and positive locations can't be mixed.
i Subscript has a positive value at location 2.

> vec_assign(1:3, c(-1, NA), 1:2)
Error: Must assign to elements with a valid subscript vector.
x Negative locations can't have missing values.
i Subscript has a missing value at location 2.


`vec_assign()` error args can be overridden
===========================================

> vec_assign(1:2, 1L, "x", x_arg = "foo", value_arg = "bar")
Error: Can't convert `bar` <character> to match type of `foo` <integer>.

> vec_assign(1:2, 1L, 1:2, value_arg = "bar")
Error: Can't recycle `bar` (size 2) to size 1.


vec_assign2() fails with incompatible type
==========================================

> vec_assign2(1:3, 2, "")
Error: Can't convert <character> to <integer>.


vec_assign2() fails with OOB subscript
======================================

> vec_assign2(1:3, 4, 0)
Error: Can't assign to elements that don't exist.
x Location 4 doesn't exist.
i There are only 3 elements.

This is a minor release with no expected breakage of any reverse dependencies.

The following reverse dependencies showed up in our checks, but we believe they are false alarms:

- GenomeAdmixR: Can't reproduce locally.
- portalr: A common failing package that we see. Likely related to a failed download.
- openalexR: A common failing package that we see. Likely related to a failed download.
- rapbase: Likely related to a failed download from GitHub.
